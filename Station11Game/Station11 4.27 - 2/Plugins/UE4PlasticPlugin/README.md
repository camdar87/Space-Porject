Plastic SCM plugin for Unreal Engine
------------------------------------

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/SRombauts/UE4PlasticPlugin](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/UE4PlasticPlugin)

This is the **official [Plastic SCM](https://www.plasticscm.com/) Source Control Provider plugin for Unreal Engine 4 & 5** (UE 4.11 to 4.27, and UE 5.0).
An old version of it has been integrated in Unreal Engine 4.24 and is shipping with it since then (equivalent to 1.4.6+).
But if you have a project of a certain size, chances are you need to upgrade manually to a version we provide from Github
in order to benefit of all the performance improvements we have made since then.
See the Status section bellow for more details.

It is not intended to replace [Plastic SCM GUI](https://www.plasticscm.com/documentation/gui/plastic-scm-version-control-gui-guide.shtml)
or [command line interface "cm"](https://www.plasticscm.com/documentation/cli/plastic-scm-version-control-cli-guide.shtml).
It is a complementary tool improving efficiency in your daily workflow with assets in Editor.

It automates tracking of assets, brings common SCM tasks inside the Editor, and provides visual diffing of Blueprints.
It also helps importing an existing Unreal Project into source control, with appropriate *ignore.conf* file.
Since Unreal does not manage C++ source code, but only assets, the plugin is especially useful for GDs and artists.

## User Guide

### Plugin Setup

#### Unreal default version of the plugin

An old version of this PlasticSCM plugin has now been integrated in Unreal Engine and is shipping with it since UE4.24.

Why: This is the easiest way to get started with Plastic SCM in Unreal Engine, but it will always be lagging behind the latest release here.

#### Manual installation from the latest version here

Why: if you want the latest features, performance improvements and bug fixes that are missing from Unreal integrated plugin.

1. Download the [latest binary release UE4PlasticPlugin-x.x.x.zip](https://github.com/PlasticSCM/UE4PlasticPlugin/releases) targeting your UE4 version.
2. Either:
    1. Unzip the content of the ZIP directly at the root of your project folder.
       This creates a "Plugins/UE4PlasticPlugin/" subdirectory into your project.
       This is the way to go to use Plastic SCM only on a specific project.
    2. Unzip the content of the ZIP in the Engine/ directory of UE4.x directly for all your projects
       (for instance "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\4.25\Engine\")
       This creates a "UE4PlasticPlugin" folder into the "Plugins/" subdirectory.
       This is the way to enable Plastic SCM for all Unreal Engine projects.
3. Then, launch you Unreal project, click on the Source Control icon "Connect to Source", select "Plastic SCM".

#### How to build from sources

Why: If your project is already a C++ project, you only have to re-generate Visual Studio project files (step 4 bellow) and the plugin will get rebuild the next time you compile your project.

Else, if you want to rebuild the plugin for a Blueprint project:

0. You need Visual Studio 2015 or 2017 with C++ language support (free Community Edition is fine).
1. Launch the Unreal Engine Editor, create a new C++ **Basic Code** Project (No Starter Content), for instance UnrealPlasticSCM. This should launch Visual Studio, build the game project, and open it into the Editor.
2. Close the Editor, then using the file explorer, create a new **Plugins** directory at the root of your project.
3. Clone the source code of the plugin into this _Plugins_ directory (for instance _Plugins\UE4PlasticPlugin_).
4. Right-click on your project's **.uproject** file, **Generate Visual Studio project files**.
5. In Visual Studio, **Reload All** and **Build Solution** in **Development Editor** mode. That's it, the plugin is built (resulting dlls are located in _Plugins\UE4PlasticPlugin\Binaries\Win64_).

To release the plugin, zip the _Plugins_ folder. But before that, remove the _Intermediate_, _Screenshots_ and _.git_ folders, and also the big *.pdb files in _Plugins\UE4PlasticPlugin\Binaries\Win64_.

### Project Setup

#### Enable Source Control

Launch you Unreal project, click on the Source Control icon "Connect to Source"
![Source Control Connect](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-ConnectToSourceControl.png)

Then select "Plastic SCM" plugin
![Source Control Connect - Select Provider](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-SelectProvider.png)

#### Create a new workspace & repository directly from Unreal

Source Control Login window, to create a new workspace/a new repository, click on "Initialize workspace" (exemple of a cloud repository):
![Source Control Login window - create a new workspace on cloud](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-CreateWorkspaceCloud.png)

Or on a server runing on localhost:
![Source Control Login window - create a new workspace on localhost](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-CreateWorkspace.png)

This creates an appropriate ignore.conf file, add all relevant files to source control (.uproject, Config & Content subdirectories)
and can also do the initial commit automatically at the end.

Wait for this to succeed before acception source control settings to not lock the UI & mess with the initialization!
![Source Control Login window - checking files in source control](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-CheckinInProgress.png)

### Status Icons

![Controlled/Unchanged](Screenshots/Icons/UE4PlasticPlugin-Controlled.png)
![Changed but not Checked-Out](Screenshots/Icons/UE4PlasticPlugin-Changed.png)

1. **New**, unsaved asset (not yet present on disk).
2. **Added** to source control (saved on disk).
3. Source **Controlled** but not changed, or **Ignored**
4. Locally **Changed** without checkout, or **Private** ie not source controlled 

![Checked-Out](Screenshots/Icons/UE4PlasticPlugin-CheckedOut.png)

![Checkd-Out/Locked by someone else](Screenshots/Icons/UE4PlasticPlugin-CheckedOutOther.png)
![Not up-to-date/new revision in repository](Screenshots/Icons/UE4PlasticPlugin-NotAtHead.png)

5. **Checked-out** for modification, and Locked to prevent other from making modifications (if Locks are enabled on the server)
6. **Renamed** or **Moved**
7. **Locked somewhere else**, by someone else or in another workspace (if Locks are enabled on the server)
8. **Not at head revision**, the asset has been submitted with a newer revision on the same branch

#### Source Control Menu

Source Control status tooltip, when hovering the Source Control icon in toolbar:

Source Control top Menu, extended with commands specific to Plastic SCM:
![Source Control Top Menu](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-SourceControlMenu.png)

#### Source Control Windows

![Submit Files to Source Control](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-SubmitFiles.png)

File History window, to see the changelog of an asset:
![History of a file](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-History.png)

Visual Diffing of different revision of a Blueprint:

#### Redirectors

When Source Control is enabled Unreal creates a redirector whenever an asset is renamed or moved,
so that other developers relying on it's old name / location can still work with other assets referencing it.

This means, you end up with two files that you have to submit, even if by default they don't show up in the Content Browser.

You can show them in the Content Browser using a dedicated filter:
![Source Control - Show Redirectors](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-ShowRedirectors.png)

You can also delete them recursively using the context menu "Fix Up Redirectors in Folder":
![Source Control - Show Redirectors](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-FixUpRedirectorsInFolder.png)

#### Worfklow

Unreal Engine workflow with binary assets works best with mostly only one branch (regardless of the source control used).

- TODO: list limitations working with branches, and possible workflow
- TODO: describe how to use Gluon to enable working without always getting latest version before a submit

### Plastic SCM Setup

#### Locking UE4 assets

[Administrator guide - Chapter 7: Configuring exclusive checkout (Lock)](https://www.plasticscm.com/documentation/administration/plastic-scm-version-control-administrator-guide#Chapter7:Configuringexclusivecheckout(Lock))

Binary assets should be locked for exclusive access to avoid merge conflicts.

To lock all assets on the whole `Content` directory, you need to put a `lock.conf` in your server directory (for instance `C:\Program Files\PlasticSCM5\server`) with this content:

    rep:<repname> [lockserver:[<server>:<port>]]
    /Content

For instance the more generic one would be:

    rep:*
    /Content

or to be more specific to one repository:

    rep:UE4PlasticPluginDev lockserver:localhost:8087
    *.uasset
    *.umap

On Plastic Cloud, you can just setup lock rules like that:

    /Content

#### Visual Diff of Blueprint from Plastic SCM GUI

In "Preferences -> Diff tools" add a new config for uasset and move it up **before** the existing `$binary` one:
![Diff tools](Screenshots/UE4PlasticPlugin-GUIDiffTools.png)

The command line needs the quoted path to the UE4Editor.exe, the quoted patch to your ".uproject" file, -diff, thant the source & destination files variables also quoted

    "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.25\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor.exe" "C:\wkspaces\MyProject\MyProject.uproject" -diff "@sourcefile" "@destinationfile"
